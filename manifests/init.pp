# Common setup and resources for the [Holland Backup Manager](http://hollandbackup.org/).
# There isn't an [Augeas](http://augeas.net/) lens for `holland.conf` in the
# upstream project yet so we'll need to provide one ourselves to manage the
# main configuration from more than one class. Since Puppet requires
# `augeas-libs` we don't need to manage the parrent directories since they'll
# already be in place.
#
